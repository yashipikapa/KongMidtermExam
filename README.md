I. Project Overview

As part of your midterm requirements, you are tasked to design and implement a consolebased Student Record Management System 
applying Linked List data structures and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
This project will assess your ability to:
    • Translate real-world problems into appropriate data structures.
    • Apply encapsulation, abstraction, and class-based design.
    • Implement linked list operations (insertion, deletion, search, update, traversal).
    • Demonstrate problem-solving skills through pseudocode and flowcharts before coding.
    • Defend and explain your code implementation.

II. Project Objectives

By completing this project, you are expected to:
    1. Develop a deeper understanding of linked list operations and their applications.
    2. Apply OOP concepts to design and implement modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
    3. Strengthen algorithmic thinking and logical problem-solving skills.
    4. Cultivate independence in coding, debugging, and documenting your own work.

III. Project Requirements

Your program must include the following features:
    1. Add a New Student - Insert at the beginning, at the end, or at a specified position.
    2. Delete a Student - Remove a student record using the student’s ID.
    3. Search for a Student - Search by student ID or student name.
    4. Update Student Details - Modify information such as Name, Course, Year Level, or GPA.
    5. Display All Students - Traverse and display all records stored in the linked list.

IV. Development Phases

A. Design Phase (Pre-Coding Requirement)
    • Prepare pseudocode for each operation.
    • Draw flowcharts representing the logic of your program.
    • Create a class diagram showing relationships among Student, Node, LinkedList, and Program.
    • Submit design documents for approval before proceeding to coding.
B. Implementation Phase
    • Implement the following classes:
    ◦ Student – encapsulates student information.
    ◦ Node – wraps a Student object and points to the next node.
    ◦ LinkedList – contains methods for insertion, deletion, search, update, and display.
    ◦ Program – contains the Main method and the user interface (menu-driven).
    • Construct a menu system that allows the user to select operations.
C. Documentation Phase
    • Maintain a Developer Diary documenting encountered errors, debugging attempts, and final solutions.
    • Prepare a short README file containing program description and execution instructions.
D. Defense Phase
    • Each student will defend their code through an oral presentation.
    • During the defense, you will be asked to explain specific portions of your code and demonstrate selected features.

V. Submission Guidelines

Submit the following items on or before the deadline:
1. Printed copy of pseudocode, flowcharts, and class diagram.
2. Source code files.
3. Developer diary (typed or handwritten).
4. Screenshot(s) of program output.
5. README file.
